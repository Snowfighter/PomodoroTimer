# PomodoroTimer

As my 1st project in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for [CS50 Mobile](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50M+Mobile/course/) I had to implement a Pomodoro Technique Timer. Basically, you set a *Work* and *Rest* timer to some number of minutes and then the app switches between them while you work on a task. There are [multiple ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) how you can mix the timers and use not just two, but I have decided to implement the basic one.

## Idea

Before implementing the in React Native I took a pen and a piece of paper and made a little draft of the app.
